//! The engine contract, split by cohesion.
//!
//! Step-driven contract (current; qwen3 is migrated, other lines follow):
//!
//! - [`step`] — the wire types: `Request`, `RequestId`, `StepOutputs` with
//!   one flat `RequestUpdate` per touched request per step.
//! - [`ledger`] — `RequestLedger`, the account book of live requests:
//!   schedulers write verdicts and tokens against it by `RequestId`, and it
//!   enforces terminal-exactly-once at the call site.
//! - [`request_lifecycle`] — the pieces that carry a request outside the
//!   ledger's reach: the submission envelope, deferred finishes, and the
//!   abort control.
//! - [`metrics`] — `SchedulerMetrics`, the per-iteration snapshot a
//!   scheduler republishes about itself.
//! - [`wiring`] — `scheduler_pair` wiring, `SchedulerHandle`, and the
//!   `Engine`/`EngineInfo` bundle a model line's `launch` returns.
//! - [`driver`] — the `Scheduler` trait and the polling `drive` loop.
//! - [`control`] — the LoRA adapter capability: vocabulary + client, outside
//!   the scheduler contract (engines mint their own channel before spawn).
//!
//! Legacy per-token contract, kept until the remaining model lines migrate:
//!
//! - [`request`] / [`event`] — `GenerateRequest` and the `TokenEvent` stream.
//! - [`sink`] — the per-request `TokenSink` over the shared tagged channel.
//! - [`kv`] — KV-prefix resolution.
//! - [`handle`] — `EngineHandle`: routing, load feed, shutdown.
//!
//! Everything is re-exported flat here, so `pegainfer_frontend::engine::X`
//! paths are unchanged by the split.
