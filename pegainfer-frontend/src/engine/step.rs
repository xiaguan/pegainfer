//! The step-batched wire contract between a model scheduler and a frontend.
//!
//! One scheduler step produces one [`StepOutputs`] message. Per request the
//! step carries at most one [`RequestUpdate`] — a flat record rather than an
//! event sequence, so the intra-step ordering rules of the old `TokenEvent`
//! protocol (`Scheduled` before tokens before a single terminal) are structure,
//! not convention: a `RequestUpdate` cannot express a token after its terminal.
//! Cross-step ordering is enforced on the producer side by the
//! [`super::RequestLedger`]: a request's account closes at its terminal, and
//! writes against a closed account panic.
