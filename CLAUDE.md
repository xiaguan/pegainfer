This file provides guidance to Coding Agent when working with code in this repository.

## What is pegainfer

Pure Rust + CUDA LLM inference engine (~7K Rust, ~3.4K CUDA). No PyTorch, no frameworks. Supports Qwen3-4B, Qwen3-8B, and Qwen3.5-4B (hybrid linear + full attention). OpenAI-compatible `/v1/completions` API.

## Build & Run

**Always use `--release`** — debug builds are extremely slow for GPU/CUDA and will timeout.

```bash
cargo run --release -- --model-path models/Qwen3.5-4B
```

**Key env vars:**
- `PEGAINFER_CUDA_SM` — GPU SM target override when `nvidia-smi` unavailable (e.g. `120` or `120,80`)
- `PEGAINFER_TRITON_PYTHON` — Python with Triton for build-time AOT kernel generation
- `PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH` — override test model path (default: `models/Qwen3-4B`)

## Tests

```bash
# Unit tests (~9s)
cargo test --release --workspace --lib

# E2E greedy regression — requires GPU + model weights
PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH=models/Qwen3-4B cargo test --release -p pegainfer-qwen3-4b --test e2e
PEGAINFER_TEST_MODEL_PATH=models/Qwen3.5-4B cargo test --release -p pegainfer-qwen35-4b --test e2e

# Single test
cargo test --release embedding_variants -- --nocapture
```

E2E tests compare against JSON baselines in `test_data/`. Regenerate baselines after any change that affects numerical output.

                                 CUDA / cuBLAS / Triton / FlashInfer
```

**Key abstractions:**

- **`pegainfer-core::engine`** — shared request/event contract (`EngineHandle`, `GenerateRequest`, `TokenEvent`) used by the server and model crates.
- **Per-model crates** — Qwen3 and Qwen3.5 own config, weights, prefill/decode/unified execution, scheduler, tests, and benches.
- **`pegainfer-core::ops`** — shared GPU operator wrappers used by model crates.
- **`pegainfer-kernels`** — tensor/FFI/kernel build owner for CUDA, cuBLAS wrappers, FlashInfer wrappers, and Triton AOT outputs.
- **CUDA Graph** — decode path captured inside model executors with pre-allocated buffers to preserve pointer stability.
- **KV state** — model schedulers own request state; shared paged-KV primitives live in `pegainfer-core`.

**Build system**: the virtual workspace root has no package build script. `pegainfer-kernels/build.rs` owns CUDA/Triton compilation:
1. Compiles `pegainfer-kernels/csrc/*.cu` with nvcc (auto-detects GPU SM targets)
2. Runs Triton AOT via `pegainfer-kernels/tools/triton/gen_triton_aot.py` for Qwen3.5 compatibility kernels

# Team Documentation Workflow

Collaboration centered on the `docs/` directory.

## Knowledge Architecture (PARA)

Based on the PARA methodology. Classify information at the point of capture — no staging area.

```
docs/
├── index.md           # Document index
├── projects/          # Time-bound efforts with clear deliverables
├── areas/             # Ongoing responsibilities requiring maintained standards
├── resources/         # Topics and references with potential future value
└── archives/          # Completed, abandoned, or shelved inactive items
```

## Documentation Style

- Docs cover what `--help` and code can't: pitfalls, diagnostic paths, decision context. Don't restate CLI reference.
- Every command in a doc must be run and verified before committing. Unverified commands are technical debt.

## Core Principles (CODE)

Documentation exists to advance work, not to hoard information. Four steps when handling information:

1. **Capture**: Only record what materially advances the project. When in doubt, leave it out.
2. **Organize**: Action-oriented. Resist the urge to organize for organization's sake — structure should be just enough.
3. **Distill**: Refactor over append. When you learn something new or hit a pitfall, integrate it into the document body — don't pile a changelog at the bottom.
4. **Express**: Every document must point to a next step. Split unwieldy documents proactively. Active documents must note the current blocker or next action.

## Collaboration Lifecycle

**Sync**

At the start of each session, you must read `index.md` and load the documents needed for the task at hand.

**Execute**
- Update relevant documents as you go. When a new problem or idea arises, create a document in the appropriate PARA directory.
- Record *why* a decision was made, not just *what* was done.

**Commit**

When a session wraps up:
- Update the TL;DR and status at the top of each modified document.
- Update `index.md` to keep the global routing table current.

## index.md Specification

The document index — nothing more:

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |

# Git Conventions

Commit messages use Commitizen format: `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`. Never commit directly to `main` — create a `feat/`/`fix/`/`chore/`/… branch first.

# Code Conventions

Module files use the flat layout (`src/ops.rs` + `src/ops/`) — no `mod.rs`.
