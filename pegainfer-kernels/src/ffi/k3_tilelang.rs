//! K3 TileLang-generated batched decode kernels (AOT).
//!
//! Built by the `k3 tilelang` section of `build.rs` from
//! `pegainfer-k3/kernels/generate.py`. Each symbol is a hand-written dispatch
//! launcher over the per-shape kernel instantiations: it returns a raw
//! `cudaError_t` as `int`, with `cudaErrorInvalidValue` for a configuration
//! that was never instantiated and `cudaErrorNotSupported` when the build fell
//! back to the stub tier (no TileLang on the build host).
//!
//! Parameter names follow the certified kernel definitions, so a call site
//! reads like the Python engine's launch sequence. `void*` operands are bf16;
//! `f32` side inputs (router bias, conv weights, KDA gate and o_norm gamma)
//! are f32 because the checkpoint stores them so, and narrowing them to bf16
//! measurably moves routing decisions.
//!
//! Every kernel is batched and `b` is a *compile-time* bucket, not a live row
//! count. The rounding rule and the buffer-size contract that follows from it
//! live in `ops::k3_tilelang`; nothing here validates them.
