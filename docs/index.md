# docs index

Organized by domain (model line / subsystem / playbook / lesson) instead of by lifecycle stage. A doc's freshness is recorded in its own header (TL;DR / Status), not by which directory it lives in.

| Where it lives | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `roadmap/` | Strategic plans and milestones — quarterly direction, product positioning. |
| `models/<line>/` | Per-model living docs: design, accuracy, perf, refactor records, gotchas. |
| `subsystems/<area>/` | Cross-cutting components (runtime / scheduler / frontend / kernels). |
| `playbooks/` | Reusable how-to: benching, profiling, accuracy debugging, onboarding. |
| `lessons/` | Tribal knowledge from research / other projects worth keeping. |
| `benchmarks/` | Standalone benchmark snapshots and eval reports. |
| `conventions/` | Ongoing standards (bench regression policy, coding style). |
| `private/` | Local-only notes (gitignored). |

## roadmap

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `roadmap/direction.md` | One size can't fit all. Shared infrastructure (frontend, runtime primitives, kernels, data plane) + per-model engines with their own scheduler/kernel DAG/state. Long-term loop: kernel ledger → simulator → request tracing. |
| `roadmap/execution.md` | Current state and immediate next steps. No timeline — entries move through In progress → Next → Open. Covers cross-model infrastructure (kernel ledger, simulator, tracing, frontend polish) and per-model active work (DeepSeek V4, Qwen3.5, Qwen3). |

## models / qwen3

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `models/qwen3/model-crate.md` | `pegainfer-qwen3-4b` owns Qwen3 config/weights/executor/scheduler/tests/kernel plan; root sees generic `EngineHandle`; split-K retuned to `256/64`, with 4k/64 serving TPOT p50 at `6.46ms` on RTX 5090. |
| `models/qwen3/kernels-crate.md` | Phase 1 split implemented and 5090-verified: Qwen3-4B kernel surface lives in `pegainfer-kernels`; release build, test-target compile, Qwen3 e2e, and bench snapshot pass. |
| `models/qwen3/tp-design.md` | Qwen3 tensor-parallel design: `TP=2` milestone scope plus the controller/worker broadcast execution model, request identity, and coarse-grained step protocol for future TP/MoE work. |
| `models/qwen3/kv-pressure-hang.md` | Issue #85 Qwen3-4B KV pressure hang fixed by full-lifetime scheduler KV admission, waiting-queue deferral, cleanup on disconnect/error, impossible-request errors, scheduler/bridge gates, and real `vllm bench serve` QPS=2 `500/500` pass with post-pressure completion healthy. |

## models / qwen35

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `models/qwen35/optimization.md` | Hybrid 24 linear + 8 full attn. At parity with vLLM: TTFT 225ms, TPOT 11.81ms (+1%). Post-accuracy-fix GDR decode kernel restore (#9). |
| `models/qwen35/accuracy.md` | Qwen3.5-4B HF parity work: major decode-state bugs are fixed, `conv1d` now matches HF's bf16 pre-`SiLU` rounding, exact HF matches improved to 11/13, and only two small-logit-drift cases remain. |
| `models/qwen35/model-crate.md` | `pegainfer-qwen35-4b` owns Qwen3.5 model/scheduler/recurrent ops/tests/benches; root loads it through `EngineHandle`. Build/check/clippy, root bench sanity check, Qwen3.5 e2e, and scheduler e2e pass. |
| `models/qwen35/e2e-gibberish.md` | Qwen3.5 e2e gibberish fixed: scheduler threads now bind CUDA context and initialize thread-local cuBLAS handles; Qwen3.5 greedy stays on FlashInfer top1, and the default e2e remains an exact golden-text regression. |

## models / deepseek-v4

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `models/deepseek-v4/support.md` | Initial DeepSeek V4 support PR record: native MP8 engine, official-style TileLang build-time kernels, exact E2E, HTTP validation, nsys-guided speed fixes, prefill RoPE reuse, sync removal, scratch reuse, and GPU index generation. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/decode-performance.md` | Fixed long decode is retained sub-30 with exact E2E `20/20` and hash `6346f03343d75a65`; stable sub-25 remains open. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/serving-baseline.md` | Serving baseline gate: HTTP single-request smoke and direct TPOT/hash regression available; bs>1 serving, continuous batching, and service-level KV management remain follow-up. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/http-serving-benchmark.md` | HTTP serving benchmark gate: streaming `/v1/completions` load records QPS, TTFT, TPOT/ITL, latency percentiles, error rate, and output hashes without using direct bench as serving evidence. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/prefix-paged-kv-pd-handoff.md` | Prefix/paged KV and P-D handoff design contract: evolves slot-owned direct KV leases into page ownership, prefix cache, allocator telemetry, and transport-agnostic handoff handles. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/moe-ag-rs.md` | Decode MoE now uses GPU AG/RS, GPU route compaction, and grouped TileLang FP4 local experts; no route/expert D2H in hot path. Current 1x32 TPOT avg `105.54ms`, exact E2E `20/20`. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/moe-tilelang-review.md` | Persistent rank workers + decode-only direct top-k MoE cut 1x32 steady TPOT to `80.49ms/token`; remaining cost is rank arrival skew before `107` f32 collectives/token. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/pplx-ep-integration.md` | DeepSeek V4 PPLX EP integration: pplx-garden decode MoE path, EP8 bootstrap, common NUMA rank-slice placement, and H200 steady TPOT p50 `66.65ms`. |
| `models/deepseek-v4/kernel-paths.md` | DeepSeek V4 CUDA sources, TileLang generator path, and `pegainfer-kernels/KERNELS.md` routing index are organized. |

## subsystems / runtime

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `subsystems/runtime/runtime.md` | Runtime complexity is controlled by a shared `pegainfer-core` that owns the generation contract and orchestration; per-model crates implement `ModelForward` so prefill/decode and hybrid attention stay hidden from the caller. State (`&mut`) is separated from weights (`&self`) for future bs > 1. |

## subsystems / scheduler

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `subsystems/scheduler/scheduler.md` | Single dedicated thread owns GPU; FCFS prefill-priority, paged KV, bucket CUDA Graphs, unified forward for mixed prefill+decode. Qwen3-4B at QPS=2 is within 2% of vLLM throughput while winning TTFT (-16%), TPOT (-3%), and latency stability. Open: ITL p99 tail, Qwen3.5 full-paged prefill, batched per-row sampling redesign. |

## subsystems / frontend

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `subsystems/frontend/simulated-inference-engine.md` | CPU-only simulated model crate for vLLM/OpenAI frontend and `vllm bench serve` validation without CUDA, real model weights, or real-model performance claims. |

## subsystems / kernels

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `subsystems/kernels/pegainfer-kernels-boundary.md` | Architecture decision: pegainfer should use reusable frontend/runtime/data-plane layers plus per-model engines; kernels become first-class assets through a ledger, simulator, and request tracing. |
| `subsystems/kernels/kernel-op-reports.md` | Qwen3 kernel report moved to a feature-gated bin; full raw-CUPTI decode/prefill reports, split prefill stages, 10k attention-core comparisons, BF16-HMMA tensor metrics, FlashInfer FMHA v2/package measurements, and measured FA2 `CTA_TILE_Q=64` prefill default in place. |

## playbooks

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `playbooks/developer-onboarding.md` | New-developer onboarding — toolchain, unified venv, build, tests, quick benchmark validation. |
| `playbooks/bench-vs-vllm.md` | pegainfer vs vLLM comparative benchmarking: method, workflow, typical configs, gotchas. |
| `playbooks/model-optimization-pipeline.md` | Per-model optimization methodology: 2 standard profiles, vLLM baseline, e2e dashboard + append-only optimization log. |
| `playbooks/profiling-guide.md` | GPU profiling playbook: nsys pitfalls, diagnostic paths, measured kernel comparisons. |
| `playbooks/accuracy-parity-playbook.md` | Accuracy debugging playbook: truth-source rules, first-diff workflow, bf16 rounding traps, and verified Qwen3.5 parity commands. |

## lessons

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `lessons/moe-dplb-decode-imbalance.md` | DPLB lesson for future PegaFlow/WiDeep MoE+EP serving: decode-side DP imbalance is a sticky KV-state problem; engines should emit raw progress while external router/proxy derive load and routing. |
| `lessons/moe-zero-prefill-long-prefill.md` | ZeRO-Prefill lesson for future long-prefill MoE serving: once a router selects long-P work, maximize batch throughput by preserving compute-bound execution, hiding expert-weight movement, respecting KV handoff boundaries, and measuring bottlenecks before committing to an AsyncEP-style backend. |

## benchmarks

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `benchmarks/bs1-4k64-vllm-pegainfer.md` | RTX 5090 single-concurrency probe: `input_len=4096`, `output_len=64`, no vLLM prefix cache. PegaInfer TTFT median `177ms` vs vLLM `198ms`; TPOT median `6.47ms` vs `6.36ms`; corrected output throughput `+6%` for PegaInfer. |
| `benchmarks/accuracy-eval-results.md` | Phase 1 GSM8K: Qwen3-4B PASS (pegainfer 85.37% vs HF 85.82%, delta -0.45%). Qwen3.5-4B FAIL — long-prompt prefill quality divergence on 8-shot. |

## conventions

| Path | TL;DR |
| --- | --- |
| `conventions/bench-regression.md` | Benchmark regression tracking: one snapshot per model, git-tracked history, TPOT >2% / TTFT >3% thresholds. |
| `conventions/coding-style.md` | Testing principle: prefer integration tests, don't test what E2E catches. |
