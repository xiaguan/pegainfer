# DeepSeek V4 Sub-80 Decode

**Created**: 2026-05-12
**Status**: active

## TL;DR

After the grouped MoE pointer-cache commit, DeepSeek V4 fixed-token long bench was `83.37-89.65ms/token`. Linux rank-worker CPU affinity moved the fixed-token long bench to `72.88-73.60ms/token` while preserving the fixed hash and exact E2E. The remaining work is pushing below 70ms without adding `bs=1` or `seq_len=1` specialization.

## Preparation

- **Read**:
  - `docs/index.md` - confirmed the just-completed 90ms project and the active MoE AG/RS history.
  - `docs/projects/deepseek-v4-90ms-decode.md` - confirmed pointer caching moved the long bench below 90ms and reduced the nsys reduce-scatter synchronization window.
  - `docs/projects/deepseek-moe-tilelang-review.md` - confirmed the earlier rank-stage proof method: group NCCL kernels into logical collectives and separate arrival skew from post-arrival tail.
- **Relevant history**:
  - The latest effective commit is `ee01f0b feat(deepseek-v4): cache moe grouped expert pointers`.
  - Post-change nsys still shows large f32 all-reduce windows: `AllReduce_Sum_f32 = 5803.26ms`, while `ReduceScatter_Sum_f32` dropped to `2040.33ms`.
- **Plan**:
  1. Inspect `/tmp/dsv4_90ms_ptr_cache_profile.sqlite` on 5090 and reproduce the logical-collective grouping method for post-change all-reduce/reduce-scatter/all-gather kernels.
  2. Identify the largest remaining collective windows by sequence position and infer whether they align with attention all-reduce, MoE reduce-scatter, embedding, indexer score all-reduce, or final logits all-gather.
  3. Choose the next implementation slice from evidence, not from kernel-name intuition.
  4. Keep fixed-token long bench and exact E2E as the gate for any code change.
- **Risks / open questions**:
  - The current trace may lack NVTX labels at collective call sites, so the first pass may need sequence-position inference before adding scoped labels.
  - Nsight Systems kernel duration is still synchronization-window evidence, not pure transfer time.

## Execution Log

### Step 1: group post-cache NCCL kernels
- Parsed `/tmp/dsv4_90ms_ptr_cache_profile.sqlite` on 5090 and grouped consecutive NCCL kernels by 8 ranks to estimate logical collective windows.
- Post-cache profile command source: fixed-token bench with `--prompt-len 1 --output-len 160 --warmup 2 --iters 3 --seed 42`; nsys profiler overhead makes absolute TPOT higher, so the trace is used for relative window decomposition.
- Main result:

| NCCL kernel | Kernels | Rank groups | Kernel duration sum | Logical wall sum | Start-skew sum | Post-arrival tail sum | Avg wall |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `AllReduce_Sum_f32` | 9048 | 1131 | `5803.26ms` | `1940.21ms` | `1370.35ms` | `569.86ms` | `1715.5us` |
| `ReduceScatter_Sum_f32` | 6075 | 759 | `2040.33ms` | `378.97ms` | `367.46ms` | `11.50ms` | `499.3us` |
| `AllGather` | 6656 | 832 | `1013.17ms` | `149.57ms` | `138.16ms` | `11.41ms` | `179.8us` |
| `AllReduce_Sum_bf16` | 144 | 18 | `10.01ms` | `2.06ms` | `1.69ms` | `0.37ms` | `114.4us` |

- Interpretation:
  - The remaining dominant collective window is f32 all-reduce, not grouped MoE FP4 compute.
  - `AllReduce_Sum_f32` still contains a large rank-arrival component: `1370.35ms / 1940.21ms` logical wall over the profiled run.
  - `ReduceScatter_Sum_f32` improved after grouped MoE pointer caching, but its wall is still almost entirely arrival skew, so NCCL duration must not be read as pure transfer time.
  - The next code slice should label or isolate f32 all-reduce call sites before changing algorithms, because the kernel name alone mixes attention hidden all-reduce, indexer score reductions, and any other f32 all-reduce with the same element count.

### Step 2: correct f32 all-reduce grouping and pick first code slice
- The first pass grouped consecutive f32 NCCL kernels by 8. That is unsafe when one logical collective has large start skew: the group can contain duplicate devices and miss another device.
- Corrected the grouping by joining `CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_KERNEL.correlationId` to `CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_RUNTIME.globalTid`, aligning each rank worker's f32 all-reduce sequence, and dropping the trace-boundary region.
- Corrected result over the stable aligned region:

| f32 all-reduce class | Groups | Logical wall sum | Start-skew sum | Tail sum | Avg wall | p50 wall |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| attention hidden `1x4096` | 747 | `764.50ms` | `751.34ms` | `13.16ms` | `1.023ms` | `1.045ms` |
| ratio-4 indexer score | 364 | `148.83ms` | `141.28ms` | `7.56ms` | `0.409ms` | `0.353ms` |

- Interpretation:
  - The dominant f32 all-reduce window is still attention hidden all-reduce, but the reliable per-window scale is about `1ms`, not the larger values produced by naive grouping.
  - The time is almost entirely rank-arrival skew, not post-arrival NCCL tail.
  - The first implementation slice targets repeated deterministic decode top-k index generation before attention all-reduce. `window_topk_indices_decode` is identical for every layer at the same `start_pos`; non-overlap compressed indices are identical for all layers sharing the same ratio.
- Code attempt:
  - Added `DecodeTopkIndices`, built once per rank per decode token.
  - Reused cached window indices in ratio-0, ratio-4, and non-overlap compressed attention.
  - Reused cached deterministic compressed indices for non-overlap compressed attention.
  - No new `bs=1` or `seq_len=1` specialization was added.
- Local validation:
  - `cargo fmt --check` passed.
  - `cargo check --release -p pegainfer-deepseek-v4 --features deepseek-v4` passed.
- 5090 validation:
  - Exact E2E passed: `All 20 DeepSeek V4 exact cases passed`.
  - Fixed-token bench round 1: `steady_tpot_ms.avg = 87.691639`, hash `6346f03343d75a65`.
  - Fixed-token bench round 2: `steady_tpot_ms.avg = 86.373297`, hash `6346f03343d75a65`.
- Decision:
  - Do not keep the top-k cache code. It is correct, but it does not move the fixed-token long bench below the existing `83.37-89.65ms` post-pointer-cache range.
  - The result suggests deterministic top-k index generation is not a dominant contributor to the remaining hidden all-reduce arrival skew.

### Step 3: separate host launch skew from GPU arrival skew
- Joined f32 NCCL kernels to CUDA runtime launch records through `correlationId`.
- Corrected aligned hidden all-reduce groups show:

| Class | Kernel wall avg | Kernel start-skew avg | Runtime launch start-skew avg | Enqueue-to-kernel max avg |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| attention hidden `1x4096` | `1.023ms` | `1.006ms` | `4.324ms` | `3.327ms` |
| ratio-4 indexer score | `0.409ms` | `0.388ms` | `4.437ms` | `4.056ms` |

- Interpretation:
  - Rank worker host launch timing is more scattered than the final GPU NCCL start timing.
  - Stream backlog hides part of the host scatter, but the remaining hidden all-reduce arrival skew is still about `1ms` per hidden collective.
  - This makes rank worker CPU scheduling a plausible contributor, so the next reversible attempt pins rank worker threads to distinct CPUs from the current Linux cpuset.
- Code attempt:
  - Added Linux-only rank worker CPU affinity at thread startup.
  - Affinity failure logs a warning and does not fail model startup.
  - This is not a `bs=1` or `seq_len=1` specialization.
- Local validation:
  - `cargo fmt --check` passed.
  - `cargo check --release -p pegainfer-deepseek-v4 --features deepseek-v4` passed.
- 5090 validation:
  - Exact E2E passed: `All 20 DeepSeek V4 exact cases passed`.
  - Rank workers pinned successfully to CPUs `0..7`.
  - Fixed-token bench round 1: `steady_tpot_ms.avg = 72.879603`, p50 `72.159356`, p95 `76.381629`, p99 `77.569638`, hash `6346f03343d75a65`.
  - Fixed-token bench round 2: `steady_tpot_ms.avg = 73.601627`, p50 `72.909497`, p95 `76.869231`, p99 `78.121858`, hash `6346f03343d75a65`.
- Post-change profile:

| Class | Kernel wall avg before | Kernel wall avg after | Start-skew avg before | Start-skew avg after |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| attention hidden `1x4096` | `1.023ms` | `0.861ms` | `1.006ms` | `0.843ms` |
| ratio-4 indexer score | `0.409ms` | `0.366ms` | `0.388ms` | `0.346ms` |

- Decision:
  - Keep rank-worker CPU affinity. It directly reduces corrected f32 all-reduce arrival skew and moves the fixed-token long bench below 80ms with stable hashes.
  - This does not reach the stricter sub-70 target yet; continue with the next largest remaining rank-arrival source.
- Rejected follow-up:
  - Tried leaving CPU0 to scheduler/main by pinning rank workers to CPUs `1..8`.
  - Fixed-token bench regressed to `steady_tpot_ms.avg = 76.729985`, p50 `75.934987`, p95 `80.571165`, hash `6346f03343d75a65`.
  - Keep the direct rank-to-first-cpuset-CPU mapping (`rank -> cpus[rank]`) on this machine.
