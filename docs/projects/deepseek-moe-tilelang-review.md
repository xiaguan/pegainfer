# DeepSeek MoE TileLang Review

**Created**: 2026-05-09
**Status**: active

## Current TL;DR

- Official DeepSeek `tile_kernels/moe` is routing/layout infrastructure, not a drop-in fused FP4 expert MLP. The useful pieces are `top2_sum_gate`, TP masking, group/count helpers, `get_fused_mapping`, `expand_to_fused`, and `reduce_fused`.
- The first local packed-layout experiment preserved exact DeepSeek V4 output, but it did not fix decode TPOT. Non-nsys `prompt-len=1`, `output-len=32` measured `171.11ms/token`; nsys measured `268.51ms/token` with profiler overhead.
- The NCCL bucket was over-interpreted: grouped by 8-rank logical collective, the trace shows most apparent NCCL duration is rank arrival skew/waiting, not pure communication. CPU rank dispatch was the first large cause; after persistent rank workers, the remaining skew mostly comes from uneven rank-local MoE decode work before each all-reduce.
- A scoped rank-thread decode slice improved 1x32 steady TPOT to `113.54ms/token`. Replacing it with 8 persistent Qwen3-style rank workers improved the same bench to `94.84ms/token`; full exact E2E passed all 20 cases.
- Persistent-worker nsys shows about `107` f32 all-reduce collectives per steady decode token. Post-arrival NCCL tail is only about `0.019ms/collective`, while arrival skew averages about `0.83ms/collective`; per-token skew is therefore the Amdahl-sized bucket. The root cause is not a single 60ms NCCL transfer, and EP8 routed expert imbalance alone does not explain 100ms TPOT. The stronger explanation is repeated rank phase skew before collectives, amplified by runtime/allocator/host-loop overhead and then serialized across 43 layers.
- Failed optimizations to avoid repeating: replacing hot zeroed allocations with uninitialized allocation regressed 1x32 TPOT to `107.52ms/token`; sharing W1/W3 FP4 activation quantization regressed it to `119.63ms/token`. Both were reverted.
- Next optimization should reduce per-rank MoE decode imbalance and/or the number of f32 collectives. Polishing kernel launch, memset, or standalone MoE expand/reduce details is not enough unless it moves the per-token skew bucket.
- Keep this profile as the decode composition baseline for the next refactor; do not judge future MoE changes only by exact e2e text pass.

## Preparation

- **Read**:
  - `docs/index.md` - identified DeepSeek V4 support, DeepSeek kernel paths, and kernel technology reference as the relevant routing docs.
  - `docs/projects/deepseek-v4-support.md` - confirmed the current DeepSeek V4 path has native MP8 runtime, TileLang build-time kernels, and a handwritten CUDA MoE path; it also notes MoE route-index D2H synchronization as a higher-risk remaining target.
  - `docs/projects/deepseek-v4-kernel-paths.md` - confirmed DeepSeek CUDA sources now live under `pegainfer-kernels/csrc/deepseek_v4/` and TileLang generators live under `pegainfer-kernels/tools/tilelang/deepseek_v4/`.
  - `docs/resources/kernel-technology-reference.md` - summarized the current kernel backend policy and why TileLang is treated as a targeted hot-kernel tool rather than a default dependency.
- **Relevant history**:
  - `docs/projects/deepseek-v4-support.md` records that the current local TileLang generator emits quantized linear, sparse attention, and HC kernels, while `deepseek_moe.cu` owns routing, SwiGLU, and expert accumulation.
  - `docs/projects/deepseek-v4-kernel-paths.md` records that the DeepSeek kernel routing table was recently organized, so this review should compare against those paths instead of rediscovering ownership from scratch.
- **Plan**:
  1. Inspect the official DeepSeek TileKernels `tile_kernels/moe` directory from `https://github.com/deepseek-ai/TileKernels/tree/main/tile_kernels/moe`, including file names, exported kernels, and expected tensor layouts.
  2. Inspect local MoE code paths: `pegainfer-kernels/csrc/deepseek_v4/deepseek_moe.cu`, related FFI declarations, and `pegainfer-deepseek-v4/src/runtime/` callers.
  3. Compare official kernels against local behavior along routing layout, expert grouping, quantization format, activation, accumulation dtype, and dispatch/combine boundaries.
  4. Summarize what official TileLang operators exist, what they appear to solve, and which local MoE issue they most likely explain or do not explain.
  5. If the gap is clear and small, propose the first implementation slice; otherwise stop with a focused diagnostic checklist.
- **Risks / open questions**:
  - The official TileKernels repository may have changed after the current local implementation was written, so source URLs and commit state need to be cited.
  - Official kernels may target a different model/checkpoint or deployment topology than the current DeepSeek V4 Flash MP8 path.

## Execution Log

### Step 1: Inspect official DeepSeek TileKernels MoE directory
- Cloned the official repository for local inspection:
  - `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/deepseek-ai/TileKernels.git /tmp/deepseek-tilekernels`
  - inspected commit `36d9e45d38e204ebb87e6f6e833821eee0482fe5`.
- Official `tile_kernels/moe/` exports:
  - `top2_sum_gate` and `topk_gate` for routing selection;
  - `normalize_weight` for row-wise top-k weight normalization;
  - `mask_indices_by_tp` for TP-local expert masking/remapping;
  - `group_count`, `aux_fi`, and `inplace_unique_group_indices` for counting/deduplicating expert/group assignments;
  - `get_fused_mapping`, `expand_to_fused`, `expand_to_fused_with_sf`, and `reduce_fused` for expert-major fused execution layout and token-layout reduction.
- Important source observations:
  - `top2_sum_gate_kernel.py` supports `sqrtsoftplus`, `sigmoid`, and `softmax` scoring, applies gate bias for selection, uses un-biased scores for weights, normalizes by top-k sum, applies `routed_scaling_factor`, supports optional fixed routing, maps logical to physical experts, and masks/remaps indices for EP/TP.
  - `get_fused_mapping_kernel.py` builds `pos_to_expert`, `pos_to_token`, `pos_to_token_topk`, `token_topk_to_pos`, `expert_start`, `expert_end`, and `num_tokens_per_expert`. This is the routing metadata needed to execute only packed token slices per expert.
  - `expand_to_fused_kernel.py` copies token activations into the expanded expert-major layout, with an optional scale-factor path for quantized activations.
  - `reduce_fused_kernel.py` gathers expert outputs back to token order and applies top-k weights.
- The checked model config at `/data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash/config.json` has:
  - `n_routed_experts=256`
  - `n_shared_experts=1`
  - `num_experts_per_tok=6`
  - `scoring_func="sqrtsoftplus"`
  - `topk_method="noaux_tc"`
  - `norm_topk_prob=true`
  - `routed_scaling_factor=1.5`

Result: official MoE TileLang is primarily a routing, mapping, packing, and reduction toolkit. It does not appear to provide a single fused FP4 expert MLP kernel in `tile_kernels/moe/`; the fused expert GEMM path is implied by the expert-major layout and the quantized helpers used around it.

### Step 2: Compare local MoE implementation
- Local score routing in `pegainfer-kernels/csrc/deepseek_v4/deepseek_moe.cu` broadly matches the model config's simple scoring semantics:
  - BF16 gate scores are converted to F32 and multiplied through cuBLAS;
  - selection score is `sqrt(softplus(dot)) + gate_bias`;
  - route weight is the original `sqrt(softplus(dot))`;
  - selected weights are normalized and multiplied by `routed_scaling_factor`.
- Local execution differs substantially from the official fused-layout path:
  - `pegainfer-deepseek-v4/src/runtime/moe.rs` copies `routed.indices` from device to host and synchronizes in both `routed_local_experts_forward_bf16_hidden` and `routed_local_experts_forward_f32_hidden`.
  - The CPU then builds `active_local` and loops over local experts.
  - For each active local expert, `local_expert_forward_*` runs W1, W3, SwiGLU, and W2 over the full input batch, then masks/weights the result by route index.
  - Official TileKernels instead keeps routing metadata on GPU, creates expert-major packed token ranges, expands inputs once, executes expert work over packed ranges, then reduces back with `token_topk_to_pos`.
- Local score routing also lacks the official `top2_sum_gate` EP/TP semantics:
  - no logical-to-physical expert map;
  - no TP-local masking/remapping in the gate kernel;
  - no optional shared-as-routed path;
  - no group top-k path, though this may be irrelevant for this `topk_method="noaux_tc"` config unless later checkpoints use grouped routing.

Result: the most likely MoE problem is not the `sqrtsoftplus` math itself for non-hash layers. The larger mismatch is the execution/layout model: local code does per-active-expert full-batch work with a host synchronization, while official TileKernels provide GPU-resident fused mapping, expand, and reduce operators for sparse expert execution.

### Step 3: First implementation slice recommendation
- Do not start by replacing the gate kernel with `top2_sum_gate`. Local gate math should first be parity-checked against official `top2_sum_gate` for `scoring_func="sqrtsoftplus"`, `num_groups=0`, `num_topk_groups=0`, `use_shared_as_routed=false`, `num_shared_experts=1`, `routed_scaling_factor=1.5`, and the current MP8 world layout.
- First low-risk runtime slice:
  1. Add CUDA or TileLang-generated equivalents of `mask_indices_by_tp` and `group_count` for the current local `i32` route-index layout.
  2. Replace the D2H `route_indices` active-expert detection with GPU-side per-local-expert counts and a fixed host policy that can avoid the route-index copy. If avoiding all host control is too large, one small `local_expert_count` D2H vector is still better than copying all token-topk indices and synchronizing on every rank.
  3. Add an operator test comparing local routing indices/weights and counts against a small official/PyTorch reference for this config.
- Larger performance/correctness slice:
  1. Add `get_fused_mapping` and `expand_to_fused` equivalents for local `i32` indices.
  2. Teach the FP4 expert linear path to run a specific expert over `expert_start..expert_end` packed token ranges instead of full `seq_len`.
  3. Replace `deepseek_weighted_expert_accum_*` with a `reduce_fused`-style token reduction.

### Unexpected
- The official MoE directory contains no obvious one-call fused FP4 routed expert MLP. The valuable part for this codebase is the routing/mapping layout, not a drop-in expert GEMM replacement.
- Official `get_fused_mapping` can still host-sync if `num_expanded_tokens=0` and `force_no_sync=false`; for runtime serving, preallocating a worst-case expanded buffer is probably the right shape.

### Step 4: Refactor plan after accepting larger scope
- The current runtime cost is structural: sparse MoE is executed as repeated full-token expert MLPs. A meaningful refactor should change the dataflow, not only tune individual kernels.
- Proposed staged architecture:
  1. **GPU-resident route metadata**: introduce a `MoeRoutePlan` beside `RoutedExperts` with route weights/indices plus local expert counts or active flags computed on GPU. This removes full `route_indices` D2H copies from `routed_local_experts_forward_*`.
  2. **Expert-major mapping**: add official-style mapping tensors for local execution:
     - `pos_to_expert`
     - `pos_to_token`
     - `pos_to_token_topk`
     - `token_topk_to_pos`
     - `expert_start`
     - `expert_end`
     - `num_tokens_per_expert`
  3. **Expand/reduce dataflow**: add `expand_to_fused` and `reduce_fused` equivalents for the local Rust/CUDA ABI. This lets expert kernels consume packed token ranges and produce packed outputs.
  4. **Ranged expert FP4 linear**: extend `deepseek_fp4_linear_cuda` or add a new wrapper so W1/W3/W2 can run for one expert over `expert_start..expert_end` packed tokens instead of the full `seq_len`.
  5. **Shared expert remains dense**: keep `shared_expert_forward_bf16_hidden` unchanged initially. It is dense by design and uses FP8, so it is not the same bottleneck as routed experts.
- Recommended first code slice:
  1. Add `deepseek_moe_local_expert_counts_cuda` and tests. It accepts route indices, `global_start`, and `local_experts`, then writes per-local-expert counts on GPU.
  2. Replace full route-index D2H with a tiny counts D2H in `routed_local_experts_forward_f32_hidden`. This is not the final design, but it immediately removes the worst synchronization volume and gives a correctness-preserving stepping stone.
  3. Add `get_fused_mapping`/`expand_to_fused` after that, because those require more ABI and memory-planning changes.
- Risk:
  - Going straight to expert-major FP4 execution touches routing, kernel generation, quantized GEMM wrappers, and NCCL accumulation at once. The first slice should preserve outputs exactly while shrinking the CPU synchronization boundary.

### Step 5: Decode profile after first packed-layout experiment
- A first local packed-layout experiment was implemented and exact text still passed on all 20 DeepSeek V4 cases, but the user-observed TPOT remained around the same high range. That result made a profile more valuable than further guessing.
- This is now the baseline profile for the MoE refactor. It explains the observed roughly `180-200ms` TPOT range better than per-kernel intuition: decode is split across collective communication, many tiny routed FP4 expert GEMMs, dense FP8 projections, quantization, and model-specific compressor/HC work.
- Non-nsys synthetic decode-heavy command:

```bash
PEGAINFER_NVCC_JOBS=8 cargo run --release -p pegainfer-server --bin bench_serving --features deepseek-v4 -- \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash --format json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 32 --warmup 1 --iters 1
```

- Result without nsys:
  - load: `35.28s`
  - steady TPOT avg: `171.11ms/token`
  - e2e: `5.47s`
  - decode throughput: `5.85 tok/s`
- nsys command used after compiling the binary once:

```bash
nsys profile --stats=false --force-overwrite=true \
  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt --cuda-graph-trace=node \
  --delay=34 --duration=14 \
  -o target/profiling/dsv4_moe_packed_decode_1x32_direct \
  target/release/bench_serving \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash --format json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 32 --warmup 1 --iters 1
```

- Trace artifacts:
  - `target/profiling/dsv4_moe_packed_decode_1x32_direct.nsys-rep`
  - `target/profiling/dsv4_moe_packed_decode_1x32_direct.sqlite`
- Result under nsys:
  - steady TPOT avg: `268.51ms/token`
  - p50: `250.31ms`
  - p95: `330.18ms`
  - e2e: `8.62s`
- The profile is nsys-inflated in absolute terms, but useful for composition. Approximate per-token breakdown from the 30 steady-token window:

| Bucket | Total in trace | Approx per token | Observation |
| --- | ---: | ---: | --- |
| NCCL f32 all-reduce | `1996ms` | `~66ms/token` | Largest single bucket; `38272` all-reduce kernels in the trace. |
| Routed FP4 expert GEMM | `1972ms` | `~66ms/token` | W1/W3 `deepseek_tilelang_fp4_gemm_n2048_k4096` plus W2 `n4096_k2048`; packed layout did not reduce decode GEMM launch count enough. |
| FP8 GEMM | `~1654ms` | `~55ms/token` | Attention/shared/compressor projections remain large. |
| Activation/FP4 quantization | `~672ms` | `~22ms/token` | TileLang act quant kernels and FP4 quant helper. |
| Compressor/HC/indexer misc | `~650ms+` | `~20ms/token` | Compressor decode, Hadamard, HC sinkhorn/mixes, indexer scoring. |
| Score gate | `~245ms` | `~8ms/token` | Gate selection plus BF16->F32 conversion and cuBLAS gate GEMV. |
| Sparse attention | `196ms` | `~6.5ms/token` | `deepseek_tilelang_sparse_attn_local_h16_d512_kernel`. |
| Packed MoE layout kernels | `~148ms` | `~5ms/token` | Mapping/expand/reduce/clear. Not the main bucket, but added work on decode. |
| RMSNorm | `114ms` | `~4ms/token` | FlashInfer RMSNorm kernels. |

  - `deepseek_moe_local_mapping_kernel`: `17.5ms`, `15784` launches, avg `1.1us`
- API/allocator signal under nsys:
  - `cudaLaunchKernel_v7000`: `1,123,549` calls
  - `cuMemsetD8Async`: `804,217` calls
  - `cuMemAllocAsync`: `803,569` calls
  - `cuMemFreeAsync`: `803,448` calls
  - `cuMemcpyDtoHAsync_v2`: `31,613` calls
- Interpretation:
  - The first packed-layout attempt did not solve decode because `seq_len=1` still executes many tiny per-expert W1/W3/W2 FP4 GEMMs. Expert-major layout is more promising for prefill than single-token decode unless the expert GEMMs are grouped or fused.
  - Decode TPOT is dominated by two roughly equal buckets: f32 NCCL all-reduce and routed FP4 expert GEMM. FP8 projections are the next large bucket.
  - The next MoE optimization should not spend much more time on standalone `expand/reduce` polish. It needs a decode-specific grouped/fused routed expert path, and the runtime also needs all-reduce count reduction or fusion.
  - Allocation/memset churn remains severe. Some of it is general runtime scratch behavior, but newly introduced packed tensors should avoid `alloc_zeros` where kernels fully overwrite the output.

### Step 6: Preserve profile implications for the next refactor
- The observed TPOT should be treated as a multi-bucket decode problem, not a pure MoE routing problem.
- Immediate implications:
  - **Routed expert GEMM**: packing helps prefill-style batches, but decode still needs grouped/fused expert execution because top-k routes produce many small W1/W3/W2 launches.
  - **All-reduce**: raw NCCL kernel-duration sums are misleading because the 8 rank kernels overlap and include rank waiting. Group f32 all-reduce by logical 8-rank collective before treating it as a communication bucket.
  - **Allocator/memset churn**: `cuMemAllocAsync`, `cuMemFreeAsync`, and `cuMemsetD8Async` counts are high enough that new MoE buffers should use reusable scratch and uninitialized allocation when kernels fully overwrite their outputs.
  - **Validation**: exact e2e pass is necessary but insufficient. Every major MoE dataflow change should be followed by the same `prompt-len=1`, `output-len=32` bench and, when needed, an nsys composition check.
- No additional profile was run while another compile was in progress.

### Step 7: Rank-thread decode CPU dispatch slice
- Static code review showed the direct DeepSeek decode loop dispatched rank-local work serially from one CPU thread. That matched the nsys shape: f32 NCCL kernels often started rank-by-rank, ended nearly together, and therefore included spin-wait in the earlier ranks.
- Recomputed the existing `dsv4_moe_packed_decode_1x32_direct.sqlite` f32 NCCL bucket by grouping consecutive 8 rank kernels:
  - `38272` f32 NCCL kernels become `4784` logical collectives.
  - Raw per-kernel duration sum: `1996ms`.
  - Logical collective wall sum: `358.69ms`.
  - Arrival skew sum: `267.07ms`.
  - Tail after final rank arrival: `91.62ms`.
  - Interpretation: most apparent NCCL time was rank arrival skew, not link transfer.
- Implemented a first decode CPU-dispatch slice:
  - `run_direct_decode_logits` now calls `block_decode_group_rank_threads_bf16_hidden`.
  - Each decode layer starts one scoped CPU lane per rank. A lane runs rank-local attention, ratio-4 indexer score all-reduce, attention output all-reduce, FFN/MoE local work, MoE routed all-reduce, and HC post for that rank.
  - Added single-rank helpers `all_reduce_hidden_fp32_in_place` and `all_reduce_f32_hidden_in_place` so each rank lane can enter NCCL directly instead of returning to a main-thread grouped caller.
  - Added explicit `Send` justification for `RankGpuContext` and a scoped `RankComm` pointer wrapper; this is a stepping stone until communicators are moved into persistent rank workers.
- Validation:

```bash
cargo check --release -p pegainfer-deepseek-v4 --features deepseek-v4
```

  - Passed with the existing unreachable-pub warnings in `runtime/core.rs` and `runtime/state.rs`.

```bash
PEGAINFER_NVCC_JOBS=8 cargo run --release -p pegainfer-server --bin bench_serving --features deepseek-v4 -- \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash --format json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 32 --warmup 1 --iters 1
```

  - load: `35.21s`
  - TTFT: `171.46ms`
  - first decode step: `107.70ms`
  - steady TPOT avg: `113.54ms/token`
  - p50: `112.77ms`
  - p95: `117.04ms`
  - e2e: `3.69s`

```bash
PEGAINFER_NVCC_JOBS=8 cargo run --release -p pegainfer-deepseek-v4 --features deepseek-v4 --bin deepseek_v4_e2e -- \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --ground-truth test_data/deepseek-v4-ground-truth.json \
  --offset 0 --limit 1 --max-new-tokens 64
```

  - Passed exact case 0.
- Full exact validation required before commit:

```bash
PEGAINFER_NVCC_JOBS=8 cargo run --release -p pegainfer-deepseek-v4 --features deepseek-v4 --bin deepseek_v4_e2e -- \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash \
  --ground-truth test_data/deepseek-v4-ground-truth.json \
  --max-new-tokens 64
```

  - Passed all 20 DeepSeek V4 exact cases.
  - Representative long-output cases after rank-thread decode:
    - case 4: `21` tokens, `127.99ms` TPOT
    - case 9: `21` tokens, `128.71ms` TPOT
    - case 12: `15` tokens, `131.45ms` TPOT
    - case 18: `14` tokens, `131.35ms` TPOT
- Interpretation:
  - The CPU rank-dispatch hypothesis was correct: a minimal rank-thread decode slice cut steady TPOT from the prior `171ms/token` range to `113.54ms/token`.
  - This slice is not the final architecture because it creates scoped threads every decode layer. The next implementation should mirror Qwen3 TP more closely with 8 persistent rank workers that own `RankGpuContext`, `RankWeightView`, `Comm`, caches, and RoPE state.

### Step 8: Persistent rank workers for direct decode
- Captured a follow-up nsys trace for the scoped rank-thread path:

```bash
nsys profile --stats=false --force-overwrite=true \
  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt --cuda-graph-trace=node \
  --delay=34 --duration=12 \
  -o target/profiling/dsv4_rank_thread_decode_1x32_direct \
  target/release/bench_serving \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash --format json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 32 --warmup 1 --iters 1
```

  - Trace artifacts:
    - `target/profiling/dsv4_rank_thread_decode_1x32_direct.nsys-rep`
    - `target/profiling/dsv4_rank_thread_decode_1x32_direct.sqlite`
  - The nsys run was heavily distorted (`138.86ms/token`) and ended with the existing NCCL abort-on-exit panic after benchmark JSON had been emitted.
  - Logical NCCL recomputation for f32 all-reduce kernels:
    - `6527` f32 NCCL kernels, `815` complete 8-rank groups in the trace window.
    - Raw per-kernel duration sum: `42165.87ms`.
    - Logical wall sum: `10448.35ms`.
    - Arrival skew sum: `10432.51ms`.
    - Tail after final rank arrival: `15.84ms`.
    - Interpretation: under nsys, raw NCCL time is almost entirely rank arrival skew / profiling distortion. The post-arrival communication tail averages about `19us` per collective.
- Implemented persistent direct-decode rank workers:
  - `load_full_direct_runtime` now starts `deepseek-v4-rank-{0..7}` workers during model load.
  - Each worker owns a cloned rank CUDA context handle, `RankWeightView`, a decode NCCL communicator, and per-rank RoPE cache. The worker thread binds the CUDA context and initializes thread-local cuBLAS once at startup.
  - Decode dispatch sends one command per rank per token. Each worker runs embedding, embedding all-reduce, HC expand, all layers, and rank-local final logits inside the persistent lane.
  - The main direct thread now only moves per-rank decode cache ownership to/from workers and performs the final logits all-gather/argmax.
  - Prefill remains on the existing group path with its own NCCL communicator. CUDA graph remains unsupported for DeepSeek V4 direct decode.
- Validation:

```bash
cargo check --release -p pegainfer-deepseek-v4 --features deepseek-v4
```

  - Passed with the existing unreachable-pub warnings in `runtime/core.rs` and `runtime/state.rs`.

```bash

  - load: `35.54s`
  - TTFT: `175.18ms`
  - first decode step: `92.94ms`
  - steady TPOT avg: `94.84ms/token`
  - p50: `94.23ms`
  - p95: `98.23ms`

  --ground-truth test_data/deepseek-v4-ground-truth.json \
  --max-new-tokens 64
```

  - Passed all 20 DeepSeek V4 exact cases.
  - Representative long-output cases after persistent workers:
    - case 4: `21` tokens, `100.89ms` TPOT
    - case 9: `21` tokens, `102.41ms` TPOT
    - case 12: `15` tokens, `103.56ms` TPOT
    - case 18: `14` tokens, `113.72ms` TPOT
- Interpretation:
  - Persistent rank workers are an effective CPU-dispatch optimization: scoped rank-thread steady TPOT `113.54ms/token` moved to `94.84ms/token`.
  - The remaining decode floor is more likely the many tiny FP4/FP8 GEMMs, activation quantization, allocator/memset churn, and model-specific compressor/indexer work than raw NCCL link time.

### Step 9: Persistent-worker nsys skew root cause
- Captured a follow-up nsys trace for the persistent worker path:

```bash
nsys profile --stats=false --force-overwrite=true \
  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt --cuda-graph-trace=node \
  --delay=34 --duration=12 \
  -o target/profiling/dsv4_persistent_workers_decode_1x32_direct \
  target/release/bench_serving \
  --model-path /data/DeepSeek-V4-Flash --format json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 32 --warmup 1 --iters 1
```

  - Trace artifacts:
    - `target/profiling/dsv4_persistent_workers_decode_1x32_direct.nsys-rep`
    - `target/profiling/dsv4_persistent_workers_decode_1x32_direct.sqlite`
  - The nsys run was distorted (`145.32ms/token`) and ended with the existing NCCL destructor panic after benchmark JSON had been emitted. Use it for composition and ordering, not absolute TPOT.
- Corrected f32 NCCL interpretation:
  - The final logits all-gather groups give `32` decode token boundaries.
  - Steady tokens contain about `107` f32 all-reduce collectives:
    - `43` attention output all-reduces,
    - `43` MoE routed output all-reduces,
    - `21` ratio-4 indexer score all-reduces.
  - Across complete steady-token f32 all-reduce groups:
    - average arrival skew: `0.830ms/collective` (`p50=0.865ms`, `p95=1.449ms`);
    - average post-arrival tail: about `0.019ms/collective`;
    - steady token intervals under nsys average `~88ms/token` of f32 collective arrival skew but only `~2.05ms/token` of post-arrival NCCL tail.
  - Therefore the raw `ncclDevKernel_AllReduce_Sum_f32` total (`~25s` in this trace) is mostly rank wait time. It should not be read as link transfer cost.
- Root-cause signal for the skew:
  - Per-device f32 collective lateness is not completely uniform, but no single device explains the bucket. Devices 1 and 3 are late most often; devices 4 and 0 are early most often.
  - The largest-skew collective ordinals have a repeated pre-collective fingerprint: routed MoE FP4 expert work. Example high-skew ordinals show latest ranks running roughly `5-7` FP4 expert kernels before entering the all-reduce while earliest ranks usually run `0`.
  - Full-trace FP4 expert kernel counts are also uneven by device:

| Device | FP4 kernels | FP4 total |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 0 | `5943` | `327.4ms` |
| 1 | `5979` | `337.1ms` |
| 2 | `6057` | `331.8ms` |
| 3 | `6225` | `346.8ms` |
| 4 | `5340` | `294.9ms` |
| 5 | `5448` | `305.0ms` |
| 6 | `6009` | `335.8ms` |
| 7 | `5826` | `324.5ms` |

  - Average FP4 kernel duration is similar across devices (`~55us`), so the imbalance is mostly how many routed local experts each rank executes, not a slow individual GPU kernel.
  - The current packed MoE decode path still does `clone_dtoh(&plan.expert_start)`, `clone_dtoh(&plan.expert_end)`, and `ctx.sync()` inside `local_experts_forward_packed_bf16_hidden`, then uses a host loop to run only active local experts. This makes rank-local route imbalance visible as all-reduce arrival skew.
  - Runtime API counts under nsys confirm the path is still heavily fragmented on rank worker threads: about `1.46M` kernel launches, `1.04M` async allocs/frees, and `40.8K` D2H memcpy calls on rank-worker threads in the captured window. These are important only insofar as they amplify the MoE imbalance; the Amdahl bucket remains arrival skew before collectives.
- Follow-up sanity check after questioning the EP8-only explanation:
  - Current runtime is best described as MP8: tensor-parallel dense/attention plus EP8-style routed expert ownership. Routed experts are not tensor-sliced within each expert; `256` experts are assigned by id across 8 ranks, `32` complete experts per rank.
  - Even in the worst per-token route imbalance, routed FP4 expert compute alone is too small to explain 100ms TPOT. In the persistent-worker trace, per-device FP4 totals are roughly `~10-12ms/token`.
  - Re-mapping the 107 steady-token collectives by code order gives average skew contribution per token:

| Collective class | Count/token | Skew/token |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| MoE routed all-reduce | `43` | `~43.0ms` |
| Attention output all-reduce | `43` | `~25.5ms` |
| Ratio-4 indexer score all-reduce | `21` | `~20.4ms` |
| Total | `107` | `~88.8ms` |

  - Late-vs-early segment decomposition shows most of the wall skew is runtime/API overhead rather than active GPU compute:

| Collective class | Late wall | Early wall | Late GPU active | Early GPU active | Late runtime/API | Early runtime/API |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Indexer | `1.613ms` | `0.642ms` | `0.170ms` | `0.169ms` | `1.449ms` | `0.552ms` |
| Attention | `0.976ms` | `0.384ms` | `0.085ms` | `0.084ms` | `0.864ms` | `0.325ms` |
| MoE | `1.379ms` | `0.379ms` | `0.402ms` | `0.115ms` | `1.240ms` | `0.329ms` |

  - Interpretation: MoE EP8 route imbalance creates some phase skew, but the 100ms-scale TPOT comes from many small phase skews being paid at every barrier. Attention and indexer collectives also pay large skew despite nearly equal active GPU work, which points at CPU runtime, allocation/free, launch gaps, and host-controlled loops as the amplification mechanism.
  - Next experiments should measure or reduce runtime churn and host-controlled MoE decode scheduling before assuming expert compute or raw NCCL bandwidth is the limiting factor.
- Temporary NVTX proof trace:
  - Added a temporary profiling-only NVTX loader using runtime `dlopen`/`dlsym` for `nvtxRangePushA`, `nvtxRangePop`, and `nvtxMarkA`, gated by `PEGAINFER_DSV4_NVTX=1`. The instrumentation marked rank worker decode stages (`attn_local`, `indexer_ar`, `attention_ar`, `moe_route`, `moe_plan`, `moe_experts`, `moe_reduce`, `shared_expert`, `moe_ar`) plus active local expert counts and per-local-expert ranges. The temporary code was removed after the trace, so it is not part of the hot path.
  - Build and trace commands:

```bash

  -o target/profiling/dsv4_rank_stage_proof.sqlite \
  target/profiling/dsv4_rank_stage_proof.nsys-rep
```

  - Trace artifacts:
    - `target/profiling/dsv4_rank_stage_proof.nsys-rep`
    - `target/profiling/dsv4_rank_stage_proof.sqlite`
  - The nsys run was distorted (`149.51ms/token`) and ended with the known NCCL destructor abort after benchmark JSON. The trace is still useful for timeline proof.
  - Clean MoE proof case: `token=12`, `layer=17`, `moe_ar`, skew `1.200ms`.
    - `rank0` entered MoE all-reduce at `+0.000ms`; its NCCL kernel ran `+0.018..+1.238ms`.
    - `rank4` entered at `+1.200ms`; before that it was still in `moe_experts` `+0.176..+1.042ms` and `shared_expert` `+1.081..+1.199ms`.
    - NVTX expert ranges show `rank4 active_local_experts=3`: global experts `129` (`+0.221..+0.632ms`), `143` (`+0.632..+0.873ms`), and `158` (`+0.875..+1.042ms`).
    - Interpretation: this is a direct proof that the long NCCL duration on early ranks is wait time; the late rank had not reached the all-reduce because it was still running MoE expert/shared work.
  - Extreme MoE phase-skew case: `token=22`, `layer=12`, `moe_ar`, skew `7.174ms`.
    - `rank5` entered at `+0.000ms`; its NCCL kernel ran `+0.018..+7.433ms`.
    - `rank7` entered at `+7.174ms`; it was in `moe_route` until `+6.738ms`, then `moe_plan`, `moe_expand`, `moe_experts` `+6.848..+7.084ms`, and `shared_expert` `+7.100..+7.173ms`.
    - Interpretation: a 7ms NCCL kernel here is still mostly waiting, but the full 7ms should not be attributed to current-layer expert compute. The late rank already carried phase delay before this MoE stage, so skew can propagate across barriers.
  - Indexer proof case: `token=28`, `layer=26`, `indexer_ar`, skew `1.199ms`.
    - `rank1` entered indexer all-reduce at `+0.000ms`; its NCCL kernel ran `+0.019..+1.231ms`.
    - `rank3` entered at `+1.199ms`; it was still inside `attn_local ratio=4` from `+0.644..+1.554ms`.
    - Interpretation: indexer/attention-side collectives also show early ranks waiting for late ranks that are still in local decode work; this is not unique to MoE expert GEMMs.
  - Practical lesson: proof should be taken from a concrete barrier window. A clean `~1ms` skew can be tied to active local expert count or ratio-4 local attention work. Larger multi-ms skew often includes phase delay carried from earlier barriers, so it should be treated as propagation unless the local NVTX window proves otherwise.
- Failed attempts recorded:
  - **Uninitialized hot outputs / memset slice**: changed hot outputs from zeroed allocation to uninitialized allocation in FP4/FP8/MoE/logits paths. `cargo check` passed, but 1x32 bench regressed from `94.84ms/token` to `107.52ms/token`. Reverted. Lesson: memset/zeroing was not the dominant Amdahl bucket, and allocation semantics can perturb scheduling enough to lose.
  - **Shared W1/W3 FP4 activation quantization**: added a paired FP4 linear wrapper to reuse one `act_quant_k4096` for expert W1/W3. `cargo check` passed, but 1x32 bench regressed to `119.63ms/token`. Reverted. Lesson: removing one quant launch per active expert did not address rank arrival skew and worsened wall time.
- Next action:
  - Stop chasing raw kernel-launch and memset counts until a change shows it reduces per-token skew.
  - Focus on MoE decode imbalance: either make routed expert execution more uniform/grouped across ranks, keep expert routing and execution GPU-resident without host expert loops, or reduce/fuse f32 collectives so each rank-local imbalance is paid fewer times.
  - Any BF16/faster all-reduce experiment must be judged by exact E2E plus logical-collective wall analysis. A faster NCCL tail alone cannot move TPOT much while `~80-100ms/token` is arrival skew.

## Debrief

- **Outcome**: Official DeepSeek TileKernels MoE source was inspected at commit `36d9e45d38e204ebb87e6f6e833821eee0482fe5`. The main finding is that official MoE support centers on GPU-resident routing selection, TP/EP masking/remapping, expert-major fused mapping, input expansion, and output reduction. A first packed-layout experiment preserved exact output but did not improve decode. Rank-thread decode showed the largest immediate issue was CPU rank dispatch/rank arrival skew, improving 1x32 steady TPOT to `113.54ms/token`; persistent rank workers pushed it further to `94.84ms/token` with all 20 exact cases passing. Persistent-worker nsys then showed the remaining large bucket is not raw NCCL transfer. It is repeated rank phase skew before `107` f32 collectives per token; EP8 routed expert imbalance contributes, but runtime/allocator/host-loop amplification is necessary to explain the 100ms-scale TPOT.
- **Pitfalls encountered**:
  - The name `moe` is easy to misread as a fused expert MLP implementation. In this repository it is mostly layout and routing infrastructure.
  - Local exact text passing does not prove the execution path matches official routing topology; it can still be correct enough for text while doing too much full-batch expert work and synchronizing through host route indices.
  - Expert-major packing alone is not sufficient for decode. With `seq_len=1`, the runtime must also group or fuse routed expert GEMMs; otherwise it still pays many small W1/W3/W2 launches.
  - Raw NCCL kernel-duration sums can mislead because they include overlapped per-rank kernels and spin-wait for slower-arriving ranks.
  - Optimizing small-looking details without Amdahl weighting can regress: uninitialized hot allocations and W1/W3 shared FP4 quantization both passed compile checks but made 1x32 TPOT worse.
- **Lessons learned**:
  - For DeepSeek V4 MoE, routing indices should become GPU-resident execution metadata. The CPU should not decide active experts from a full D2H route-index copy in the hot path.
  - The next useful kernel import is likely `mask_indices_by_tp` / `group_count` or `get_fused_mapping`, not `topk_gate`, but decode performance ultimately needs grouped/fused routed expert execution.
  - DeepSeek MP8 decode should keep the persistent worker architecture. Worker-owned contexts/comms removed the per-layer thread lifecycle cost and lowered the dispatch skew enough to make smaller GPU buckets visible.
  - After persistent workers, the next performance question is why ranks reach each collective at different times. Current evidence points to route-dependent MoE expert work count plus runtime/API amplification from allocation/free, launch gaps, D2H synchronization, and host-controlled local-expert loops, not NCCL link bandwidth.
- **Follow-ups**:
  - Build the next experiment around reducing MoE rank-local imbalance or reducing the number of f32 collectives, then recompute logical-collective skew.
  - Add a targeted MoE routing parity test against official `top2_sum_gate` semantics for the current config.
  - Decide whether to keep packed layout only for prefill and add a separate decode-specific routed expert kernel.
