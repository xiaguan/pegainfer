"""Generate the K3 TileLang batched decode kernels (AOT).

Emits one `.cu` per kernel family under `--out-dir`, covering the batched
decode kernel set:

    k3_rms_norm_rbs_batched.cu      k3_conv_silu_batched.cu
    k3_land_rms_norm_rbs_batched.cu k3_kda_core_batched.cu
    k3_attnres_scores_batched.cu    k3_attnres_mix_batched.cu

The batch size is a static compile-time dimension, so a single-stream step is
served by the `B = 1` instantiation of the same family — its per-row spelling
is word for word the certified single-row kernel, which is what the upstream
bitwise gate proves. There is therefore no separate bs=1 kernel set. The dense
projections are served by cuBLASLt, the routed experts by the DeepGEMM
masked grouped-GEMM chain, and MLA decode by the hand-written absorbed
paged-attention kernel (`csrc/k3/k3_mla_paged_attn.cu`), so neither a GEMV
family nor an attention family is generated here.

Each file is [shared TileLang preamble] + [one renamed `main_kernel` per
instantiation] + [one hand-written `extern "C"` dispatch launcher]. TileLang
always names the entry point `main_kernel`, so every instantiation is renamed
to a shape-tagged symbol before concatenation; the launcher is the only
non-generated code in the artifact and returns `cudaErrorInvalidValue` for a
configuration that was not instantiated. One family per translation unit is
also what lets nvcc compile them in parallel.

The kernel definitions themselves are the vendored, certified spellings in
`tilelang_defs.py` — this file only walks the configuration lists, checks the
codegen contract, and wraps. It never rewrites kernel bodies.

Output is a Cargo `OUT_DIR` build artifact and is never checked in. Run
standalone with `--vendor-includes` to produce a self-contained pre-generated
directory for build hosts that cannot run TileLang (see README.md).
