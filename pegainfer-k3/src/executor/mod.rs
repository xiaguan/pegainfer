//! The GPU decode executor: one rank's model, its slot state and the step that
//! turns a batch of last tokens into a batch of next tokens.
//!
//! ## Slots
//!
//! A slot *is* a batch row: slot `i` owns row `i` of every state slab, and a
//! step runs the compiled bucket that covers the highest occupied slot. Rows a
//! step does not own are computed and discarded — the batched kernels are
//! row-independent, so their presence cannot move an owned row's result. There
//! is no compaction yet: a sparse slot set costs a wider bucket, not a wrong
//! answer.
//!
//! What a padding row cannot do is stay still. It is fed a placeholder token
//! and its recurrent state advances like everyone else's, so **a seat's state
//! is only meaningful while the seat is in every batch**. That is the contract
//! the scheduler already keeps — a running request is decoded every step — and
//! [`K3Executor::prefill`] resets the seat at admission, so a sequence never
//! inherits what the padding steps left behind. A caller that parks a live
//! sequence for a step and comes back to it gets the parked row destroyed.
//!
//! ## Prefill
//!
//! Prefill runs the batched step over **chunks of one sequence**: the bucket's
//! rows carry up to `chunk_tokens` consecutive prompt tokens (default: the
//! 16896-row MegaMoE protocol maximum, clamped to `max_ctx`), so every
//! row-independent stage (norms, projections, MoE) digests the whole chunk
//! in one launch, the MLA layers attend `[context | chunk]` through one
//! dense FlashMLA FMHA call per layer over kv_b-expanded scratch, and the
//! KDA recurrence crosses the chunk as one chunkwise FlashKDA forward per
//! layer ([`forward::k3_prefill_chunk_step`]). Chunk steps skip the batched
//! epilogue; the boundary token is sampled once after the final chunk
//! ([`forward::k3_prefill_boundary_sample`]). It runs on a
//! **separate state pool**
//! rather than on the sequence's own slot, because a batched step advances
//! every row of its bucket: prefilling in place would step the sequences
//! already decoding. The pool keeps one row of KDA/conv state (the recurrence
//! is sequential anyway) but a full bucket of attention-residual snapshots and
//! block-table rows. When the prompt is consumed the pool's state is copied
//! into the slot, and the slot joins the batch.
//!
//! ## Graphs
//!
//! Decode is captured per (bucket, parity) and replayed; the H2D feed of the
//! step's inputs and the D2H of the sampled ids stay outside the capture, as in
//! the reference engine. `PEGAINFER_K3_CUDA_GRAPH=0` forces the eager path.
//!
//! `ep_size > 1` runs eagerly for now — capture works on the single-rank fused
//! path, but a captured cross-rank launch has never been replayed here and the
//! kernel's device barriers pair the world inside it, so that is its own piece
//! of work rather than a default.
//!
//! ## Expert parallelism
//!
//! Ranks are free-running: each has its own scheduler thread and its own
//! requests, and the only runtime coupling is the fused MoE launch inside the
//! step ([`ep`]). Two consequences show up here:
//!
//! * an **empty batch is a real step**, not an early return — the rank owes its
//!   peers a launch per MoE layer either way, so it takes one with every row
//!   padding;
//! * **any error is fatal**. A rank that skips a step leaves every peer inside a
//!   device barrier it will never reach, so the rank exits the process instead
//!   of returning into the scheduler's keep-serving path.
