//! Context-parallel (CP) prefill: one long prompt split contiguously across
//! the expert-parallel ranks, each rank walking its own segment through the
//! same chunk step, with three per-layer exchanges stitching the segments
//! back into one sequence (see `docs/models/k3/cp-lane-design.md`):
//!
//! * **KDA (KCP)**: the recurrence's per-token update is affine in the state
//!   (`S' = A·S + b` with `A`, `b` functions of the inputs alone), so a whole
//!   segment collapses to `S_out = M_seg·S_in + D_seg`. Each rank exports its
//!   `(M, D)` package in one fused FlashKDA pass (`k3_flash_kda_fwd_md` —
//!   kernel 1 once, a dual-state kernel 2 carrying `M` from an in-kernel
//!   identity seed with `v = 0` and `D` from a zero seed with real `v`) —
//!   then every rank folds its upstream packages into its true input state
//!   with per-head fp32 GEMMs and runs the real forward once. Rank 0's real
//!   forward *is* its package (`D`, with a known zero input), and the last
//!   rank exports nothing.
//! * **conv halo**: a segment's first `K3_CONV_STATE` convolution windows
//!   reach into the previous segment. The upstream rank publishes its last
//!   `K3_CONV_STATE` *normed* rows; the receiver projects them through the
//!   q/k/v bands itself and lands them as its carried window — the batched
//!   conv kernel then runs unchanged.
//! * **MLA**: each rank publishes its segment's post-norm latent and rope
//!   rows; a rank assembles rows `0..seg_end` straight into the dense-FMHA
//!   context scratch (the paged gather is bypassed). The causal triangle is
//!   then *striped* across the gang ([`k3_cp_stripe_kept`]): a rank attends
//!   its own segment causally and its odd-distance upstream segments
//!   densely, while each even-distance upstream rank attends this rank's
//!   published queries over its own keys and returns output + LSE for the
//!   owner's log-sum-exp merge — the deep rank's `r + 1` segment-pairs
//!   become at most `(r + 3) / 2`.
//!
//! The exchange transport is in-process ranks and plain peer-access
//! device-to-device copies, with every ordering edge expressed **on-device**
//! through CUDA events — the host never syncs a stream inside a superstep.
//! Each of the roughly `2 × 69 + 24 × (1 + stripe slots)` windows per
//! superstep runs the same four-beat protocol on every rank:
//!
//! 1. record my *publish* event (all my publish writes are enqueued), then
//!    announce it through my `published` counter;
//! 2. for each rank I read from this window, spin (host, enqueue-side only)
//!    until it announced, then make my stream wait on its publish event;
//! 3. enqueue my peer reads, record my *consume* event, announce it;
//! 4. for each rank that reads *my* buffers this window, spin until it
//!    announced, then make my stream wait on its consume event — so my next
//!    window's publish writes cannot overwrite what a peer is still reading.
//!
//! The host spins wait only for peer *enqueue* progress (announces follow
//! enqueue-only work), so enqueue threads run the whole superstep ahead of
//! the GPUs and every real dependency resolves stream-to-stream. One event
//! pair per rank suffices: a wait can only ever attach to the intended
//! record or a *later* one on the same stream (the counter handshake orders
//! record before wait at enqueue time), which is at worst conservative,
//! never early. Counters are monotonic across supersteps — every rank
//! passes the same collective window count, so the slots agree at each
//! superstep boundary even as CP ranks rotate.
